# Remuneration-management-roles-by-gender

This project is an assignment from 365-careers' Business Intelligence Analyst Course using the fictional [employees](https://github.datacharmercom/datacharmer/test_db) dataset created by [datacharmer](https://github.com/datacharmer).

## Installation
The code requires MySQL verson 8.0.* 

## Project motivation
This was an assignment to practice integration of MySQL and Tableau for data analysis. The final product needed to be a Tableau dashboard visualising:
- a breakdown between the male and female employees working in the company each year, starting from 1990. 
- a comparison of the number of male managers to the number of female managers from different departments for each year, starting from 1990.
- a comparison of the average salary of female versus male employees in the entire company until year 2002.
- the average male and female salary per department  using a stored procedure.

## File description
The code is available in the MySQL file `Employees-management.sql` and the .csv files for use in Tableau Public software are:
- `gender-breakdown.csv`, 
- `manager-gender.csv`,
- `salaries.csv` and 
- `dept-salaries.csv`.

- The data Visualisation is available [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/panashe4489/viz/Remuneration-management-roles-by-gender/Dashboard1)
